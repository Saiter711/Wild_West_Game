The picture above shows how the starting window looks like.
You can see that you are able to check the highscores and quickly learn about how the game works.


## What do I do?
First you need to write your nickname down and choose the difficulty of the game:

Then, the game starts:

The game is about shooting moving objects on the panel. You have to shoot as many objects as you can, considering how many bullets you have left.
The game consists of four levels, on each one you have to shoot 20 objects. Here's a look from one of the levels:

With each level, the objects become slower and move faster, so that it's not too easy!


### What can I shoot to?

The objects that you can shoot are:
* Mathematical shapes - rectangles, squares, triangles and circles.
* Picture shapes - these ones put you more in a real cowboy shoes.

Example of picture shapes:

The objects that you shoot to are random.


### Extra packages

There is also a possibility of gaining some more bullets to your pocket. If you reach certain level, there is a possibility of shooting one of the packages, that grant you extra bullets.
There are also extra sounds available.


## The end

After you run out of bullets or shoot everything that needed to be shot, you are presented with your score. It is simply the number of targets you've shot. 
You are also added to the list of scores and who knows, maybe if it's high enough, you will get to be on the high scores list.
